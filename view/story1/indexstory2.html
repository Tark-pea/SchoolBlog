	<h1>My Story</h1>
	
	<p>
		<font color="#ffffff">I was bullied from kindergarten to 7th grade. I'm going to mention 7th grade. I would get bullied for no reason but there were around 5 kids mainly. My friends knew about it but told them not to help because I don't want them to have the same problems as me. One time during lunch I recorded an audio for the whole lunch. Today, there was this one girl that I hated and she was a snitch. She got the whole class but my friend yelled at me to shut up. My friend had been lying to me about getting bullied every day. My friend was holding back tears from how bad she felt for me getting bullied. The girl that started this brought her to the bathroom to help her calm down. when she came back she got everyone to blame me for making her cry. I got my friend and we left without saying anything because it was ridiculous. The school did nothing about it because a new principal was hired and the problem was that the principal didn't do anything. Another story is that I made a friend. He had autism, like me. The same group of 5 students tried to convince him that I'm a bad person and other messed up things. Luckily my friend didn't care or listen. We are still friends today. their kids were attacking me for no reason and I hated it. their kids would try and get my best friends that i knew for years to stop being friends with me. My friend group grew over the years at that school and I had about 6 kids in that group. They are together because of me. I have a group of 11 now because of friends I made at this school. this school actually did stuff. Also, I would have kids just bullying me for no reason. new kids would bully me without even getting to know me. I'm just thankful to be able to still talk with my friends now even though I'm not at the same school no more. I thought I was getting bullied for having ADHD and autism. That was not it, it was just they wanted to. I just hope it's over soon.
